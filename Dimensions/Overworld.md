also is where you start playing the
[Galacticraft](Galacticraft "wikilink") mod when you create a world. In
the context of the mod, the Overworld represents the real-life Earth is
represented by the *Overworld* - i.e. where you start.

The Overworld is where everyone starts out in Galacticraft. You build
your home base, and develop space technology here from there onward.
