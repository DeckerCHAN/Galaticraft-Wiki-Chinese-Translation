**月球**是你能够通过[一级火箭](Tier 1 Rocket "wikilink")到达的第一个天体。它的表面上布满了灰色的方块。月面原本是十分平滑的，但月面上充满了由陨石砸出的陨石坑。当你在月球上走动的时候，你的身后将会留下脚印。
[陨石](Fallen Meteor "wikilink") 可能在月球上掉落

月球的重力为[主世界](/Overworld.md)的18%，重力影响玩家、怪物、弓箭和掉落的物品。掉落伤害同样是主世界的18%，不同于主世界的3格，你需要至少从16格以上的高度掉下才会受到掉落伤害 (`3 m / 0.18 ≈ 16.67 m`)，从127米以上掉落将会受到致命的伤害(`(20 生命值 / 0.18) + 16.67 m ≈ 127.78 m`)

The moon is uninhabitable by Overworld creatures due to the lack of
[Oxygen](Oxygen "wikilink"). On the other hand, you can find [Moon
Villages](Moon Village "wikilink"), an alien version of Overworld
villages.

The Moon dimension number is -28.

Prerequisites
-------------

The Moon can be reached with the use of a Tier 1 Rockets, which can be
built at the [NASA Workbench](NASA Workbench "wikilink").
[Rockets](Rocket "wikilink") of higher tiers can be used, but they are
more expensive.

Day-night cycle
---------------

The Moon's day-night cycle is 2h 40min long, equaling 8 Overworld days.
The daytime on the moon lasts from full moon to new moon (4 Overworld
days, equaling 1h 20min) and, logically, the nighttime lasts from new
moon to full moon. Since the 1st Overworld night is full moon, you can
have a safer landing within the 1st 4 Overworld days, and then the next
4 Overworld days are more dangerous since hostile mobs will be able to
spawn in the dark, and so on. If you miss the counting, the moon phases
can tell you when it is daytime or nighttime on the moon.

During the nighttime, the environment light levels go very low, allowing
hostile mobs to spawn on the surface.

### Sky

The Overworld seems to be always fixed high up in the sky and only the
Sun moves as the time passes by, but this is not entirely true. In fact
the Overworld does move not because of the time but if the player
travels away from the Moon's equator line (z = 0). The Overworld
*apparently* moves northward if the player travels southward, and
southward if the player travels northward. If the player travels to z =
12,000 or z = -7,000, the Overworld is seen at the horizon line.

### Time and Conversions

-   Lunar Sunrise = 1st Overworld day sunrise = `/time set 0000` = real
    time: 00h00min
-   Lunar Noon = 3rd Overworld day sunrise = `/time set 48000` = real
    time: 00h40min
-   Lunar Sunset = 5th Overworld day sunrise = `/time set 96000`= real
    time: 01h20min
-   Lunar Midnight = 7th Overworld day sunrise = `/time set 144000` =
    real time: 02h00min
-   Lunar Sunset = 9th Overworld day sunrise = `/time set 192000` = real
    time: 02h40min

Geological Features
-------------------

The surface of the moon is formed by craters and is covered by [Moon
Turf](Moon Turf "wikilink"). Underneath it there is [Moon
Dirt](Moon Dirt "wikilink"), and underneath that you will find [Moon
Stone](Moon Stone "wikilink"). In the lower levels caves with [Moon
Copper Ore](Moon Copper Ore "wikilink"), [Moon Tin
Ore](Moon Tin Ore "wikilink") and [Cheese Ore](Cheese Ore "wikilink")
will generate. The moon has no naturally occurring lava.

Sometimes you may also find [Fallen Meteors](Fallen Meteor "wikilink")
on the surface of the moon.

You can also find man-made holes, which are the entrance to [Moon
Dungeons](Moon Dungeon "wikilink").

Structures
----------

The moon features two kinds of generated structures: [Moon
Villages](Moon Village "wikilink") and the [Moon
Dungeons](Moon Dungeon "wikilink").

Mobs
----

### Passive Mobs

The only passive entity that spawns natively and lives on the moon is
the [Moon Villager](Moon Villager "wikilink"). Unlike normal villagers,
they cannot trade, and only walk around in their Moon Villages.

### Hostile Mobs

At night and under low light levels, [Evolved
Creepers](Evolved Creeper "wikilink"), [Evolved
Skeletons](Evolved Skeleton "wikilink"), [Evolved
Zombies](Evolved Zombie "wikilink") and [Evolved
Spiders](Evolved Spider "wikilink") will spawn.

### Bosses

The Moon's boss is the [Evolved Skeleton
Boss](Evolved Skeleton Boss "wikilink"), which is found in the Moon
Dungeons.
