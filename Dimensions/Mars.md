**Mars** is the second planet ever added to Galacticraft. Its surface
consists of brownish-reddish blocks and is quite irregular with craters,
mountains, deep valleys and a special crater which is the entrance for
the [Mars Dungeon](Mars Dungeon "wikilink"). Unlike on the moon, you do
not leave footprints. [Meteors](Fallen Meteor "wikilink") may also fall
on Mars.

The gravity on the planet is 38%, so the fall damage is also 38% of
Overworld's. You need to fall more than 8 meters to start getting fall
damage, unlike the 3 meters on the Overworld (`3 m / 0.38 ≈ 7.89 m`),
and more than 60 meters for a fatal fall
(`(20 HP / 0.38) + 7.89 m ≈ 60.53 m`).

Just like the [Moon](Moon "wikilink"), Mars has no
[Oxygen](Oxygen "wikilink"). Living on Mars is harder than living on the
Moon because there is no water, trees or
[villages](Moon Village "wikilink") where you can seek protection and
resources.

Mars's dimension number is -29.

Prerequisites
-------------

Currently, Mars can only be reached with the use of a [Tier 2
Rocket](Tier 2 Rocket "wikilink"), as opposed to a [Tier 1
Rocket](Tier 1 Rocket "wikilink"). Thus, trying to fly to Mars with a
Tier 1 Rocket is impossible. Tier 2 rocket schematics can be found in
[moon dungeons](Moon Dungeon "wikilink").

Day-night cycle
---------------

Mars's day-night cycle is synchronized with Overworld's, and is
therefore 20 minutes long, made up of 10 minutes of daylight and 10
minutes of night.

After sunset, the environment darkens but not as much as the Moon's and
hostile mobs will be able to spawn on surface. Since the sunrise and
sunset of both planets happen at the same time, the best moment to
travel to Mars is during the Overworld's dawn (about 1.5 minutes before
the sunrise), so that you have enough time to set up a quick base on
Mars before the sunset.

Due to a bug, the sun and stars are visible only on far-view distance.
The Overworld is visible though.

Geological Features
-------------------

### Surface

The surface of Mars is riddled with craters, tall hills and deep valleys
and its height may vary sharply from y=50 to y=140. It is covered by
[Mars Surface Rock](Mars Surface Rock "wikilink") and, underneath it,
[Mars Sub-Surface Rock](Mars Sub-Surface Rock "wikilink"). The martian
soil is completely sterile, unless you use a
[Terraformer](Terraformer "wikilink") to convert it into cultivable
soil.

### Underground

The planet's underground features include caves like those of the
Overworld's and sludge-flooded caves which are large and tall circular
rooms underground, where poisonous plants, the [Cavernous
Vines](Cavernous Vine "wikilink"), grow from the ceiling and the floor
is mostly flooded with Bacterial Sludge.

[Tin](Tin Ore "wikilink"), [copper](Copper Ore "wikilink"),
[iron](Iron Ore "wikilink") and [Desh](Desh Ore "wikilink") ores can be
found on Mars.

Naturally generated lava and water pools do not exist.

Structures
----------

Mars features only one kind of generated structures: [Mars
Dungeons](Mars Dungeon "wikilink").

Mobs
----

### Slimeling

[Slimelings](Slimeling "wikilink") are tameable mobs found on Mars.
[Slimeling Eggs](Slimeling Egg "wikilink") have a chance to spawn on the
surface of Mars. They can be red, blue or yellow. They can be renamed
and fed to create mini-slime Bodyguards. They can breed with one another
to create more slimelings and the color of the new slimeling is the
color of the parents combined.

### Sludgeling

[Sludgelings](Sludgelings "wikilink") are some kind of macro-bacteria
that spawn in swarms in the [Bacterial
Sludge](Bacterial Sludge "wikilink"). They attack any mob, including the
players. A Sludgeling swarm takes place when any mob touches or gets
close enough to the bacterial sludge.

### Boss

The Mars boss is the [Evolved Creeper
Boss](Evolved Creeper Boss "wikilink"), which can be found in the Mars
dungeons. The boss is a three-headed giant Creeper that has an [Oxygen
Mask](Oxygen Mask "wikilink") and shoots TNT at the player on sight. The
only known way to defeat this boss is by reflecting the TNT against it.
