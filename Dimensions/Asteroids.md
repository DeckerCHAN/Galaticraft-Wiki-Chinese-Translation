**Asteroids** is the name of the 3rd dimension in [Galacticraft
3](Galacticraft 3 "wikilink"). It is farther away than
[Mars](Mars "wikilink").

The entire dimension is made of floating rocks varying in size, from 1
up 30 blocks large. The gravity is very low (microgravity). A player
without the ability to fly can jump from asteroid to asteroid - there
are enough small rocks between the large ones that that is normally
possible, at least with the help of a [Grapple](Grapple "wikilink").

Asteroids' dimension number is -30.

Prerequisites
-------------

The Asteroids can only be reached with the use of a [Tier 3
Rocket](Tier 3 Rocket "wikilink"). Thus, trying to fly to this dimension
with a [Tier 1 Rocket](Tier 1 Rocket "wikilink") or [Tier 2
Rocket](Tier 2 Rocket "wikilink") is impossible. [Tier 3 Rocket
Schematic](Tier 3 Rocket Schematic "wikilink") can be found in a [Mars
Dungeon](Mars Dungeon "wikilink").

Day-night cycle
---------------

The Sun does not move. The Sun is not bright here due to the distance,
making the whole dimension relatively dark.

Geological Features
-------------------

The asteroids are made of rock and [ice](Dense Ice "wikilink") blocks.
Ores can also be found, including [iron
ore](Asteroid Iron Ore "wikilink"), [aluminum
ore](Asteroid Aluminum Ore "wikilink") and [Ilmenite
Ore](Ilmenite Ore "wikilink") which can be used to produce
[Titanium](Titanium Ingot "wikilink").

Structures
----------

For now, there are only few structures inside some asteroids: a
hollowed-out asteroid with grass and glowstone, where mobs can spawn. In
the future other structures will be added.

Mobs
----

Moving small asteroids can damage the player, so stay out of their way.
