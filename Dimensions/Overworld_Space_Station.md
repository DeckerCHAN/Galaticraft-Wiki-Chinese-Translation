The **Overworld Space Station** is a feature added in version 0.1.23.
Each space station has a dimension of its own, but has no terrain and
has a greatly reduced level of gravity. Currently space stations can be
created only for [The Overworld](The Overworld "wikilink").

When this dimension is created, it only generates a small room attached
to a flat platform for your [Parachest](Parachest "wikilink") to land on
as well as for launching a rocket. The room and platform are constructed
of [Tin Decoration Blocks](Tin Decoration Block "wikilink"). The room
can be expanded and built upon however you like to create your own
custom space station. This station appears to be orbiting the Overworld
which can be seen below the station. If you happen to fall off the
station you will continue to fall to the Overworld.

Overworld Space Station dimension number is SPACESTATIONx, where *x* is
a number greater than or equal to 2.

Creation
--------

![Standard Space Station with Sealing
Station](O.S.S..png "fig:Standard Space Station with Sealing Station")
To create a space station, fly your [Tier 1](Tier 1 Rocket "wikilink")
or [Tier 2 Rocket](Tier 2 Rocket "wikilink") to space. You will then be
given the option to create a space station in the [Planet Selection
Screen](Planet Selection Screen "wikilink") so long as you have the
required materials in your inventory (required materials listed below).

The components below will assemble a basic space station comprised of a
small main room with the roof and corners built, a platform where you
can place a [Rocket Launch Pad](Rocket Launch Pad "wikilink"), and a
[Parachest](Parachest "wikilink") containing your
[rocket](rocket "wikilink") and a small amount of left-over fuel that
can be collected using an [Empty Liquid
Canister](Empty Liquid Canister "wikilink"). The station does not have
any sort of [oxygen](oxygen "wikilink") or other life support so you
should [prepare accordingly](Tutorials/Oxygen "wikilink").

Some recommended supplies include:

-   [Oxygen Mask](Oxygen Mask "wikilink"), [Oxygen
    Gear](Oxygen Gear "wikilink"), and [Oxygen
    Tanks](Oxygen Tank "wikilink")
-   Food and Building Materials
-   [Oxygen Collectors](Oxygen Collector "wikilink"), [Oxygen
    Distributors](Oxygen Distributor "wikilink"), and [Oxygen
    Compressors](Oxygen Compressor "wikilink")
-   Trees, wheat, or other source to collect oxygen from

It is recommended that you read the [oxygen
tutorial](Tutorials/Oxygen "wikilink").

Once you have the materials, grab your rocket and launch into space!
Once the Planet Selection GUI shows up, select the "Create Space
Station" button at the top of the screen. There should be a new option
in the Planet Selection GUI with "Space Station" in its name (you may
also rename your space station on this screen after it has been
created). Select it and hit the "Go to Dimension" button to go to your
Space Station.

After you have made the Space Station you may want to add some [Oxygen
Sealers](Oxygen Sealer "wikilink") and [Oxygen
Distributors](Oxygen Distributor "wikilink") and some [Air
Locks](Air Lock "wikilink").

If you are still using the old Galacticraft, the materials required to
create a space station depend on the prerequisite mod you installed,
either [IndustrialCraft 2](IndustrialCraft 2 "wikilink"), [Thermal
Expansion](Thermal Expansion "wikilink") or [Basic
Components](Basic Components "wikilink").

Day-night cycle
---------------

The Overworld Space Station's day-night cycle is synchronized with The
Overworld's, and is therefore 20 minutes long, made up of 10 minutes of
daylight and 10 minutes of night.

Mobs
----

Mobs of any type, hostile or not, do not *naturally* spawn in the space
station regardless of light level or block type. You can however keep
animals in the space station as long as you provide them oxygen in order
to keep them alive.

Galacticraft 3
--------------

### Spin Thrusters

With the release of [Galacticraft 3](Galacticraft 3 "wikilink"), your
space station is capable of rotating with the use of [Spin
Thrusters](Spin Thrusters "wikilink"). In order to make your space
station rotate, place anywhere from 1-4 Spin Thrusters on the side of
your space station and it will begin to rotate on its own. The rate of
spin depends on how many thrusters are installed. You may add more than
four, but any more than that will not affect the rotation speed. The
speed at which the station rotates is determined by both the number of
thrusters installed and the direction that they are facing. For example,
if you have all 4 thrusters installed but 2 are facing one direction and
2 are facing the opposite direction then the forces cancel each other
out and the station will not rotate at all. The direction a thruster is
facing can be changed by right-clicking each thruster using a [Standard
Wrench](Standard Wrench "wikilink").

The larger your station is, the longer it will take to reach full speed
for the given number of thrusters you have installed. The space station
will rotate around the center of gravity of the station, not the "Blue
Block" that is in the first room when a space station is first created.
This center of gravity is re-calculated every time a spin thruster is
placed so it is suggested that you build the station first and add the
thrusters last so it rotates around your final design. Thrusters that
are attached to blocks which are not connected to the main mass of the
space station (i.e. "floating" blocks) may not have any affect on the
overall rotation of the station or may prevent it from rotating at all.

Note: When a space rotation is spinning, the "F3" coordinates are in
relation to the blocks of the space station and not the dimension as a
whole. Therefore it is not recommended to navigate open space by using
the "F3" coordinates. Example: If your space station is spinning while
you are floating stationary above it (the station is spinning beneath
you while you're still), you will see that your coordinates are
constantly changing because your position in relation to the station is
changing.

### G-Force

Not only will it take longer for a large station to reach maximum speed,
the maximum rotation rate on very large stations is limited to whatever
rate creates a G-Force of 1G at the outermost extremity of the station.
This means that no point on a space station will exceed a total G-Force
greater than 1G, even if the speed of rotation must be limited to
maintain that force. G-Force effects are generally most noticeable on
large space stations and may not even be noticeable on small stations.

#### Effects

When a space station is spinning it will create a G-Force which varies
depending on how large the station is and how fast it is spinning. This
G-Force creates an effect that will push you outward from the center of
gravity of the station based on centrifugal force. The amount of force
increases the further you are from the space station's center of
gravity. This effect only applies while you are *floating* near a
contact surface such as a long wall. It does not affect the player if
your feet are planted on the floor, in which case you may walk around
normally.

### Gravity Changes

In addition to the introduction of [Spin
Thrusters](Spin Thrusters "wikilink") and G-Force, Galacticraft 3 also
changed the way gravity works while on a Space Station. The gravity on
space stations is supposed to more closely mimic a micro gravity
environment and it is therefore possible to float while in the dimension
unlike in previous Galacticraft versions. This is referred to as a
"Freefall" condition. Alternatively, you can "land" on blocks which
allows you to walk around normally. While in Freefall, you still have
some freedom of movement. You can move forward and backward with a small
boost by pressing W/S respectively. This boost is said to be caused by
the assumed use of small bursts of your oxygen supply in order to
navigate, although the oxygen bursts are not visible nor will it consume
any additional oxygen. You can move sideways using A/D, however this
movement is slight and is only temporary meaning you will stop moving as
soon as you release the A/D key. You may also move up or down using
SPACE/SNEAK in much the same way as W/S, but this results in a much
lower impulse movement. The longer you hold SPACE/SNEAK, however, the
greater the speed you can achieve. While in Freefall, if you are
floating within about one arm's length of a structure or block, you will
come to a stop more quickly mimicking the idea of "grabbing" the
block/structure with your hand to better control your movement. As long
as you maintain a close enough proximity to a block, your movement will
be more immediate, more controlled and more precise (less drifting)
compared to movement while "out of reach" of a block or structure.

Commands
--------

On Multiplayer, you have to invite other players to your space station
first, in order for them to be able to join you.
